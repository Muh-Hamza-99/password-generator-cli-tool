# password-generator-cli-tool

## 📃 Description:
A CLI tool that creates and manages passwords. 

It includes two versions. ```/simple``` allows for customisation of auto-generated passwords and saving them to a ```.txt``` file. ```/advanced``` allows for saving 
custom/auto-generated passwords to a ```.txt```, which are then encrypted using a secret key and random bytes. The secret key can be accessed by a unique email address
via email using the Sendgrid API, allowing for the passwords to be decrypted.
